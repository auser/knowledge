Knowledge base for me

## Setup

As I'm working on getting setup on a new machine, there's all sorts of tooling
that I need to install. Instead, I've created a installer that sets everything
up for me so I no longer have to do it manually.

## Use at your own decision

This project works well for my setup, so maybe it will work for yours, or maybe
not.
